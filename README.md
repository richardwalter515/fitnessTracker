## Description <a name="description"></a>
This Fitness Tracker allows the user to create and keep track of new workouts, or continue previous ones.  When the user clicks 'new workout', they have the ability to select 'resistance' or 'cardio,' and will then be able to fill in the details of the workout and save it in a database powered by MongoDB.  If the user wants to see their stats for the last 7 days, they can click the 'dashboard' and see how they've been doing!
